# When running the tests, or building the demo application, the
# @folio/eholdings package is not visible by default.... Only things
# that are in the `node_modules` directory can be loaded. This changes
# that by linking the current directory to the module so that it can
# be required from the test cases and the demo app.
#
# In other words, our test files can require('@folio/eholdings') and
# our demo stripe platfrom can require('@folio/eholdings'). Without
# this link it will throw an ModuleNotFound error.
